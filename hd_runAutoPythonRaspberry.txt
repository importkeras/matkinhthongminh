Auto-run Script Setup
Now we need to tell the operating system to run the script for the Pi user. In the command prompt or in a terminal window type :

sudo nano /etc/profile
Scroll to the bottom and add the following line :

sudo python /home/pi/myscript.py
where “/home/pi/myscript.py” is the path to your script.

Type “Ctrl+X” to exit, then “Y” to save followed by “Enter” twice.

A Script Without End
You will only be returned to the command line when your script is complete. If your script contains an endless loop then you may want to use this line in the profile file instead :

sudo python /home/pi/myscript.py &
This will allow the script to run in the background but you will not see any text output from it.
